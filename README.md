### Hello there!

My name is **Dylan Green**! I'm a software developer particularly invovled in application development as well as kernel development. My best experiences come from the low-level, and on projects that ordinary people use every day. Feel free to get ahold of me any way you'd like.

Here are some interesting things to know about me:
 - My first experience with code was at the age of 13, as I was desperate to create Minecraft Mods in Java back in the day. I never knew what I had gotten myself into...
 - I used to be a moderator and developer for a little social platform called Novanius. It ran for some time, but didn't make it far. The developers have improved in skill by a longshot since then, and I still know many of the other developers personally.
 - By far my favorite platform is .NET, considering it's becoming more and more cross-platform with every release. Amazing stuff!
 - Operating Systems have been a passion of mine. I like knowing a machine and system inside and out, as well as taking simple and modern approaches whenever I can.
 - My favorite project is *PiousOS*. It's not terribly fancy, but I take the "simple, but modern" approach in any way I can, while still optimizing things myself. It's great having that level of control to learn and work with.

My (incomplete) website can be found here: https://www.dylangtech.com with my full list of projects, as well as additional contact information. Can't wait to hear from you!
